# Introduction
This project is a decentralized SSE design following the similar SSE design originated by Cash et al. (CCS 14), which is deployed among a private blockchain using Amazon Web Service. It enables a user to derive the auditable query result over encrypted data that leaks zero knowledge in the private blockchain setting assuming write capability is restricted to certain organization(s).

Aside from 

We follow the SSE design of CCS 14 Cash et al and apply it to the private blockchain.
